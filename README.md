## Magic ðŸŽ±-Ball Game ##

### ðŸ”® About ~ ###
This is a classic Magic 8-Ball Game, where you input a question and the 8-ball will tell you your fortune through a randomized answer (for this project, there are 15 possible answers, which are from the original 8-Ball game).

The goal of this project was to sharpen my Javascript skills, and design a modern and responsive user interface using Bootstrap and some CSS. I've also created the main 8-Ball floating illustration, using CSP and a Wacom One 13 tablet.
