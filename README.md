## Magic ðŸŽ±-Ball Game ##

### ðŸ”® About ~ ###
This is a classic Magic 8-Ball Game, where you input a question and the 8-ball will tell you your fortune through a randomized answer (for this project, there are 15 possible answers, which are from the original 8-Ball game).

The point of this project was to learn more Javascript and JQuery,familiarise myself further with Bootstrap, and create a visually appealing user interface design.

### ðŸ”® Tools ~ ###
* HTML/CSS (content and more customized styling)
* Bootstrap (for layout)
* Javascript/JQuery (randomizing answers and other effects)
* Clip Studio Paint (for drawing main 8-Ball illustration)
